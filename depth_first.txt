Depth first search algorithm is an algorithm for traversing tree data structures.
It aims at traveling through a tree in order to explore a path all the way to a leaf before backtracking to parent nodes where it explores another path.

This is achieved by using a stack to save pointers to nodes which it then uses for later processing.
